There are a few cool formations that , but how to find em ? I have spent a lot of time finding cool formation that have apprenticeship, distance learning and available in English.
So I created this crawler in Python to go through all the formations/programs available on this [Campus France list](https://www.campusfrance.org/fr/trouver-formation-universitaire-France), 
and find the keyword "apprentice", "apprentissage", or whatever keywords you want.


Cool formation that I tried myself:
- CNAM ENJMIN - Licence Informatique Jeux Video (I found out about this school by reading a book):
  - apprenticeship from year 1 (after 3 months at school)
  - Fully distance-learning, you just have to come to school twice every year, 1 week each
  - Learn about video games development (Unity, UE4), game and level design, 3D (blender), sound design etc...Very generalist
  - You got 1 final game projects to develop in a team every year (super concrete). Example of my 3rd project: https://hans-min.itch.io/crashed-world, where I was in charge of the procgen of the map.
- CAWEB - Universite de Strasbourg (https://foad.campusfrance.org/#/program/1035)
  - Quite flexible, they let me in M2 directly since I have some professional experience from my previous apprentice from CNAM ENJMIN ;)
  - Every course is in English (noice)
  - Also fully distance-learning, just 1 week in October where you have to come to school
  - You get a Language Master, not the ideal one for me 
  - Also a generalist course, we learn web development (HTML, CSS, JS, Vue), marketing(SEO, content), Design (UX, Photoshop, Illustrator), Project Management, Translation
  - Quite some practice on web development: I created 2 websites:
    - https://github.com/hans-min/mini-project-CAWEB: A website that teach you about async in JS, cat-theme, check it out 
    - My personal portfolio: Still working on it, coming soon
